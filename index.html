    <p>If you’re here, that likely means a project linked you here.
    <p>Thanks so much for being interested in that project!
    <p>Open Source is rewarding - but it can also be tiring.
    <p>The linking project’s code is provided as-is, and is only vaguely maintained.
    <p>Maybe the author(s) provide security support guarantees, for example, but no other kinds of ongoing maintenance. You should see if there are specifics in the project's README!
    <p>The author(s) of that project invite you to file bugs and send Pull Requests/Merge Requests/patches. However, they want to make it clear that they've got a lot of other stuff going on in their life, so these contributions may or may not be looked at for a really long time. When sending code contributions, smaller is way better.
    <p>Of course you're also welcome to fork the project for your own needs; just be sure to give credit where it’s due! Maybe eventually your changes will be upstreamed (but no promises).
